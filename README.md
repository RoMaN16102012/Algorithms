# Algorithms

### Description

*Algorithms is an framework inlcuding all algorithms and data structure + some extensions to embeded Swift Collection (see. below) that commonly used for iOS/Mac/tvOS development*. 

Besides that in scope of some algorithm investigation, performance tests have been measured (See. Benchmarks).

### Programming language

Swift 5.2 & Objective-C 2.0

### Algorithm List

- [x] **Priority Queue** - framework contains Swift implemenation of [*Priority Queue*](https://github.com/RoMaN16102012/Algorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/PriorityQueue/Swift/PriorityQueue.swift), based on own [*Heap*](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/blob/master/Heap) implementation, and wrapper around Apple's [*CFBinaryHeap*](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfbinaryheap).
- [x] **Ordered Set** - framework contains Swift implemenation of *Ordered Set*, based on own implementation of [*Ordered Set*](https://github.com/RoMaN16102012/Algorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/SortedArray/Swift/OrderedArray.swift), and wrapper arround [*NSMutableOrderdSet*](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableorderedset).
